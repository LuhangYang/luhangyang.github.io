## About myself
I am a PhD candidate in physics at Northeastern University. My [research](https://luhangyang.github.io/research/) focuses on theoretical and numerical condensed matter physics. 

I am from a small but historic city in the middle area of China. When I was at school age, we didn't have much fun things to do after school, so my mother spent a lot of time talking and playing with me after work. I can still remember we sit on the sofa together after dinner and looking at the clock on the wall, and she gave me the question "How many times the hour hand and minute hand meet in a day, and when?" That's a hard question for a primary school kid, so she explained to me over and over again, everyday, until I feel totally comfortable about the logic behind it. That's my first exposure to math and physics. From then on I started to love reasonings and logics, although I was only learning very old math and physics at that age.
I started to learn and study modern physics since I joined the PhD program. This is a whole new world. I really enjoyed the time I spend in reading, thinking and calculating. Trying to build a map in mind when walking in a massive maze is very challenging but also provides endless fun.
