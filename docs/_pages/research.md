### Quantum phase transition

- **From deconfined spinons to coherent magnons in an AFM Heisenberg chain with long range interactions**  [SciPostPhys.10.5.110](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.10.5.110).

     In this paper we have studied the spin 1/2 AFM Heisenberg chain with additional RKKY type non-frustrated interactions. With these long range interactions the AFM order is enhanced and realize true symmetry breaking in the ground state, which gives a testbed to observe phase transition from magnetically ordered phase to disordered phase when tuning the coupling parameter. We have studied the coherent quasiparticles in this model, witness the quantum phase transition between spin liquid and ordered phase, and show in more details about coherent quasiparticles are formed using numerical tools.

- **Quantum criticality in AFM quantum spin ladders with long-range interactions** [arxiv:2012.14908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14908).

    Continued from the previous study for spin 1/2 on 1D, we have extended this idea on quasi-1D, i.e. a ladder model. In this paper we have studied the phase transition from a magnetically ordered phase to a dimer phase with hidden non-local symmetry breaking, and we tried to characterize the transition and identify the excitations. Although it is not conclusive about whether there are deconfined spinons in the vicinity of transition from our stuudy, we still found solid evidence for the second order phase transition accompanied with gap opening.
